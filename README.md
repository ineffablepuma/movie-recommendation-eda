# Movie Recommendation System – EDA

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a movie dataset to understand patterns in movie ratings, genres, and popularity. The insights gained can be used to build a simple rule-based movie recommendation system.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze movie ratings and popularity
- Understand genre distribution
- Identify highly rated and most popular movies
- Build logic for simple movie recommendations

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 EDA Tasks Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Rating distribution analysis
- Genre-based analysis
- Popularity analysis using vote counts
- Visualization of insights

## ⭐ Recommendation Logic (Simple)
Movies are recommended based on:
- High average rating
- High number of votes
- Matching genre

## ▶ How to Run
1. Place the CSV dataset inside the `data/` folder
2. Open Anaconda Prompt
3. Run `jupyter notebook`
4. Open `notebooks/eda_movie_recommendation.ipynb`

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Content-based filtering
- Collaborative filtering
- Machine learning models
